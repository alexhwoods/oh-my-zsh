This is my personal fork of oh-my-zsh, a configuration tool for the Z shell. You should probably use the original.

## Installation

1. Install Z Shell and set as default shell
```shell
sudo apt install zsh; chsh -s $(which zsh); exit
```

2. Install this repo
```shell
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alexhwoods/oh-my-zsh/master/tools/install.sh)"
```
